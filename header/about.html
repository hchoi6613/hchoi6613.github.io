        <h1>Fun facts about me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Hana! I was born in Korea and moved to Chicago suburbs with my family when I was 11.

        <p>
            My passion for design started when I took my first Photoshop class in high school. I immediately fell in
            love with how easily it was to change around things in computer and craved for learning more about different
            design programs since then.
        </p>

            My previous experience includes internships and part-time roles at <a style="color: #7a52a1;"
                href="https://www.linklogistics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Link Logistics</a>,
            along with freelance
            projects for food and beverage businesses. My interest in UX design began when I discovered the power of
            research-driven solutions, understanding that effective design extends beyond visual aesthetics.
        </p>

            I'm currently working at <a style="color: #7a52a1;" href="https://www.so-design.co/" target="_blank"
